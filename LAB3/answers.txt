			~~~~~~~~ The FIND-S algorithm ~~~~~~~~

h0 = <0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0>
h1 = <Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same>
h2 = <Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same>
h3 = <Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same>
h4 = <Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, ?, ?>
h5 = <Sunny, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ?>

			~~~~~~~~ Learned the target concept ~~~~~~~~

<Sunny, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ?>

Therefore, only one additional training example (i.e. example 5) is required to exactly learn the above target concept.
